The precise source of this claim, however, has not been found and its accuracy is disputed.<br />\n<br />\nThe first well-documented usage of the term ""heavy metal"" referring to a style of music, appears to be the May 1971 issue of Creem, in a review of Sir Lord Baltimore\'s Kingdom Come. In this review we are told that ""Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book"".<br />\n<br />\nRegardless of its origin, heavy metal may have been used as a jibe initially but was quickly adopted by its adherents. Other, already-established bands, such as Deep Purple, who had origins in pop or progressive rock, immediately took on the heavy metal mantle, adding distortion and additional amplification in'","b'First, metal music was termed that way to provide contrast to the 50\'s life affirming Buddy Holiday rock\'n Roll AND also against ""Summer of Love"" counter culture rock with its emphasis on peace and love.  <br />\n<br />\nIn contrast, metal music emphasized morbidity and glorified ancient civilizations as well as heroic struggles, merging the gothic attitudes of art rock with the broad scope of progressive rock, but most of all, its sound emphasized heavy: a literal reality that cut through all of our words and symbols and grand theories, to remind us that we are mortal and not ultimately able to control our lifespan or the inherent abilities we have. This clashed drastically with both the pacifist hippie movement and the religious and industrial sentiments of the broader society surrounding it. <br />\n<br />\nAlso ""heavy"" is from the drug culture term ""hey, that\'s heavy man"" when bringing up downer conversation topics.'",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None

Who is going to be looking at it, and what are the important characteristics for the end product?<br />\n<br />\nThe first and most important question is to understand who the possible viewers are, and what playback technology they have available to them. Obviously, you want to pick something that your users will actually be able to view, preferably without requiring a new codec install.<br />\n<br />\nIf audience compatibility is less of an issue, you can focus in on the actual performance of the video codec. All compression schemes have tradeoffs in terms of quality, file size, and time-to-compress. A ""good"" compression scheme has a high quality-to-size ratio for your application. For example, if small file sizes are particularly important, certain codecs are better. If you\'re dealing with a large quantity of video, you may also want to consider the time required to create the encoded video file, as more computationally complex codecs can require more time.<br />\n<br />\nThe Wikipedia has a good overview (see reference materials cited below).'",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None

What is still open for debate is how much of the warming is due to human activites, and what all the potential effects will be worldwide.

The good news is that life survived all those previous events, the bad news is that there could be significant negative political and economic consequences to such a rapid shift.<br />\n<br />\nIn terms of what we can do, everyone can work to reduce carbon emissions... but we need to realize that such a fix will not stop warming for quite some time.  Current models show that even with a complete halt to human based carbon emissions, that the world would not stop warming for decades.  This same lag effect has made it difficult for scientists to finally agree that long term warming was taking place.  Now we have enough data to be pretty sure on that, but we don't have many solutions as how to significantly slow the warming.<br />\n<br />\nUltimately, it would be ideal for the human race to move toward energy and economic growth solutions that would sustainable in the long long term (centuries or more)... To reach that state we need to move entirely to renewable energy sources and close the loop on materials and toxics used in manufacturing.

"b""Why don't European restaurants serve water?""","b'On a recent trip to Europe, I was struck by the fact that most restaurants frown on giving you a glass of tap water, even if you ask (and even though their tap water is clean and tastes fine).  Instead, they make you pay a lot of money for bottled water.  In Amsterdam, restaurants charge 2 euros (about $2.50) for a 200 ml bottle of water -- enough for one small glass, or about half a can of soda.\r<br><br>Do Europeans just not drink much water?  Or just not in restaurants?'","b""There's a general belief in Europe (and in fact elsewhere in the world, such as China) that it's unhealthy to drink water with a meal because it dilutes the digestive juices. Wine is OK because it stimulates digestion, and mineral waters are also considered digestives.<br />\n<br />\nIn general, Europeans are much more concerned with the digestive process than Americans.""","b""There's a general belief in Europe (and in fact elsewhere in the world, such as China) that it's unhealthy to drink water with a meal because it dilutes the digestive juices.

I think geographical location and higher availability of other drinks probably is a bigger reason that water is not consumed as much by people in certain regions, including Europe. I believe and many visitors have commented that children drink less water and more soda in USA.  This is primarily due to the fact that soda companies advertise a lot, making it more attractive. Secondly, SODA IS ATTRACTIVE, and according to a few medical experts it\'s even addictive (yes, caffeine is addictive to some extent).  <br />\n<br />\nSecondly the cold weather in upper northern hemisphere in general is more of a reason that ppl drink less water and more of other drinks.  For example if you are from a tropical country or from a very humid place, you would probably & naturally  be drinking more water rather than if you are from   a country like Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland.<br />\n<br />\nAnother reason is that people being less immune to impure water (like tap water) and being more dependent on bottled water makes the water less affordable and less available.  If you need to pay  extra or need to work harder to get the commodity, you may resort to cheaper commodity or a near by commodity.<br />\n<br />\nAnother reason I also feel is the commute using Cars rather than walking or cycling.  If you walk more to commute (like walk to train stations, walk a few blocks to get groceries, etc.) then you are more likely to drink water when compared to driving to every place you go and exert yourself much less.  In many other countries people walk, walk and walk for several small things.<br />\n<br />\nLack of education and awareness is also a reason for not consuming enough water. Not many people (except for few educated ones)know that 80% of our body is water.  Even if they knew, ppl forget that fact easily and resort to ""other drinks"".<br />\n<br />\nThere are simply several reasons or combination of reasons for not consuming enough water by the people in general.<br />\n<br />\nFinally, after having said all this,<br />\nBeer Happens!'",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None

I had access to the Grub loader, so I had it easy.<br />\n<br />\nIf you\'ve lost your root password, you might be able to recover it this way. However, some systems are protected with boot loader passwords that won\'t let you do that without THAT password. If the boot loader is password protected, you need to boot from other media - for newer systems, the install CD probably has the recovery tools for that (""linux rescue"" for example).<br />\n<br />\nBut let\'s try it the easy way first. The first thing to try is to boot to single user mode. This MIGHT not work for you, because your system might be configured to still ask for a root password to get to single user mode. If that\'s the case, we\'ll use another trick that replaces init with /bin/bash.<br />\n<br />\nFirst, try single user. If you don\'t see either a LILO or GRUB boot screen, try hitting CTRL-X to get one. If it\'s LILO, just type ""linux single"" and that should do it (assuming that ""linux"" is the lilo label). If GRUB, hit \'e"", then select the ""kernel"" line, hit ""e"" again, and add "" single"" (or just "" 1"") to the end of the line. Press ENTER, and then ""b"" to boot. (More modern grub uses ""a"" to append to the boot line)<br />\n<br />\nYou should get a fairly normal looking boot sequence except that it terminates a little early at a bash prompt.

b'Why do we yawn?',b'How is it contagious...',"b'Found an interesting article on this...<br />\n<br />\nYawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing. During yawning, the mouth involuntarily opens due to the spasm of mastoid muscles. These spasms, without your permission, force you to take a deep breath. It also involves many other muscles of your body, such as abdominal muscles. Lung ventilation increases, sending oxygen to the brain. Extra blood is pushed from the liver and spleen to the brain stem. During yawning, intellectual activity stops and for a moment we cannot think. We usually start yawning when we are very tired, before sleep, when we are too excited, or extremely serious. <br />\n<br />\nThere is a yawn center in our brain that makes this act a reflex like coughing or swallowing. The yawning reflex is very contagious, forcing people to imitate it. This phenomenon even has a fancy name: alolomimea. Yawning can be easily conditioned to become a bad habit. If you fight the urge to yawn, it will return in a similar situation. Yawning is what your body develops to get a \xe2\x80\x9ctime out\xe2\x80\x9d to recharge for a brief moment. It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. <br />\n<br />\nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy.'","b'Found an interesting article on this...<br />\n<br />\nYawning is a unique breathing act, which is different from the usual practice of breathing.

It is a signal that we are running out of gas, it is a signal to rest. <br />\n<br />\nThis is a great compensatory mechanism, without which we would drop into sleep suddenly without warning, as in patients with narcolepsy.'","b'Many people assume that we yawn because our bodies are trying to get rid of extra carbon dioxide (CO2) and to take in more oxygen (O2). This may make some sense. According to this theory, when people are bored or tired, they breathe more slowly. As breathing slows down, less oxygen makes it to the lungs. As carbon dioxide builds up in the blood, a message to the brain results in signals back to the lungs saying, ""Take a deep breath,"" and a yawn is produced.<br />\nThe only problem with the excess CO2 theory is that research shows that it may not be true. In 1987, Dr. Robert Provine and his coworkers set up an experiment to test the theory that high CO2/low O2 blood content causes yawning. Air is normally made up of 20.95% O2, 79.02% N2 (nitrogen), 0.03% CO2 (and a few other gases in low concentrations). The researchers gave college students the following gases to breathe for 30 minutes:<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nGas #1<br />\n100% O2<br />\n Gas #2<br />\n3% CO2, 21% O2<br />\n Gas #3<br />\n5% CO2, 21% O2<br />\n Gas #4<br />\nNormal Air<br />\n <br />\n<br />\nBreathing 100% O2 (Gas #1) or either CO2 gas (Gas #2 and #3) did cause the students to breathe at a faster rate. However, neither CO2 gas nor 100% O2 caused the students to yawn more. These gases also did not change the duration of yawns when they occurred.<br />\n<br />\nThe researchers also looked for a relationship between breathing and yawning by having people exercise. Exercise, obviously, causes people to breathe faster. However, the number of yawns during exercise was not different from the number of yawns before or after exercise. Therefore, it appears that yawning is not due to CO2/O2 levels in the blood and that yawning and breathing are controlled by different mechanisms.'",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None

I would budget about $200 for accessories if you don't have any.\n\nI would recommend the large manufacturers: Cdale, Specialized, Trek, Giant -- they are vol. makers so they have better stuff in the lower price ranges (crazy to think that $1500 is a lower range!).  Without getting too technical, think also about the type of riding you want to do: rec, more serious, or just commuting.  depending on which, i would spend time at a good LBS getting the best fit for your size and riding style.  I can't stress enough, how important a good fit is to biking.  you can always swap out for better components (derailluers, pedals, wheels...) at a later date, but swapping out a frame b/c it kills your back or neck, is a much bigger deal $$$.\n\nFor $1500, you can get either alum or steel. nowadays, good steel tubing is much ligher and can match close to alum frames.  i just switched from alum to steel, and the steel is even lighter (but I'm also going from $800 specialized to $3000 IF bike!).  I'd recommend at least looking at steel frames b/c of comfort (soaks up vibration better), and repairability, altho they need a little more maintenance in moist environments.\n\nGood luck. Your best bet is to find a good LBS with salespeople who are willing to spend time with you in your decision, getting a good fit and outlining bike options.  There are innumerable sites with recs on bikes but prolly the best ones are www.roadbikereview.com  or www.bikeforums.com\n\nHappy riding!""",None,None,None,None,None

b'Does a spoiler over the rear window of a 2000 bug really do anything?',b'Or is it mostly for styling?',"b""On the bug, the spoiler really serves two purposes:\n\n1) Visually differentiates the turbo model in a low key way\n\n2) By disrupting laminar flow over the roof of the car, reduces the lift (rather than increasing downforce) generated by bernoulli's principle.

My Evo's spoiler is a good example of a functional piece (it is homologated as a racing aero part).  It's about a foot tall and has a flat airfoil.  Even with a wing that size you don't really see an effect until around 60-70 mph, which is useful on a track but not really on the street.

However, if you're a bit of a lead foot, they can actually do some good.  Depending on the type of spoiler, its size and the placement of it on the car, it could help a bit with handling and, although very minutely, could also improve gas mileage in the long run.  Spoilers create downforce by directing the airstream the flows over your car at speed.  The higher your speed, the more downforce is created.  Typically, spoilers don't really do much benefit at speeds lower than 55-60 mph (Always observe posted speed limits!).\n\nI don't claim to be an expert but I have been an avid car fan for 20 years.

b'Is there any proven evidence that Mars at some point in the past had microscopic life?',b'what supports this theory?',"b'The answer to your question is no.  There is no absolutely definitive evidence to date.  We do have very strong evidence that significant amounts of water once existed on the Martian surface, and some recent results show that Martian water may still exist below ground, and under heavy packs of ice.    There are many scientists who believe that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which would have made it a considerably wetter and warmer place.  Given this, and the ability for solar system bodies to seed each other via ejecta from large impacts, Mars could very possibly have been seeded by Earth or vice versa many billions of years ago.  Still, we\'re not sure if life exists or every existed there.    The most recent chapter was the recent discovery of methane there.  Methane can be created by non-biological processes, but we have not observed the right conditions for this on Mars.

Tozer called ""Understanding the Holy"" (link below).  A fantastic book that explores each of the attributes of God that He has revealed through His Word.\n\nSomething to understand about God includes that He is infinite in all of His attributes.  He has infinite goodness, justice, mercy, grace, love along with other infinite attributes.\n\nOne attribute, that applies to all His attributes, is that He is immutable.  He is unchanging.  He requires nothing to complete Him. He is perfect.  His love never changes, nor does His mercy, nor His justice.\n\nHe has chosen to create us for the purpose of fellowshipping with beings that possess free will.  Free will gives us the ability to choose to worship God or not. We ultimately have the ability to choose to screw everything up, or not.  God desires that we do not suffer, but as a result of the choices men made we have suffering.  \n\nBut there is a plan to alleviate the suffering.  And that is through redemption.  \n\nJohn 3:16-17 says ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life.  For God did not send His Son into the world to condem the world, but to save the world through Him.""'","b'Speaking as a parent, I suffer with my children when they are hurt or suffering.

In the mean time, read the account of Joseph in Genesis for a great look at hatred, betrayal, deception, and enslavement and how God used it all to save an entire nation.'","b'For those who say that if there is no suffering, there can be no love.\nWhile there is logic in such for those who have escaped suffering to say this, can you truly say it is justified for the people who have suffered in absolute poverty, rotting in disease, and plagued with great suffering, some with suffering they have never inflicted on themselves, but are born with it?\nAre you saying that God created them as a scapegoat for a set group of people born in more fortunate locations and countries to ponder that sentence?'",b'suffering exsists to help us to grow in jesus sometimes its a punishment for something that you have done but alot of times he has people go though hard times to grow in him and realize some things that you personally have to fix in your life.  in the bible it says to trust in Lord for he is good. so we have to just trust him because he has our whole life planned out',"b""Frankly, the answers thus far show a complete lack of understanding of basic theodicy and even the Christian Bible.

The short version is that suffering is the necessary product of combining free will and the knowledge of good and evil.  If you know about evil and have free will, you _can_ commit evil.  But the solution in this book really treats your question like a logic puzzle.\n\nI found a vastly more emotionally satisfying answer in Orson Scott Card's series of short stories The Worthing Saga (second Amazon below).  The stories that most fully answer your question revolve around a world that uses their powers of telekenisis and telepathy to basically remove the knowledge of evil or the pain of misfortune.\n\nBut the final answer is that this is purely a matter of faith.  I'd recommend the last CDs of Johnny Cash for some examples of sin (Delia's Gone, Hurt) and redemption (Unchained, Why Me Lord?) and just good soulful tunes (the whole Mother's Hymn Book album).

b'Why is news and media coverage in the USA so inwardly focused?',"b""With the USA having been the 4th country I have lived in, I am curious as to why the media/government wants to keep the general populous so inwardly focused. You find very little mention of things/events around the rest of the world in the main-stream media here. What's your take on this issue?""","b'A large part of the America-centric focus of the American media is as a result of its structure. Let me explain: the American media is more privatized than any other media system in the world. Take the BBC, for example, it is a government-sponsored media outlet (rather than commercially sponsored) and it was conceived as a tool to educate the public. The American media -- first print, then radio, then television -- evolved as a system that is primarily supported by the money advertisers pay broadcasters for ad space. Advertisers are interested in at least two things: 1) the largest audience share (they race to capture the median viewer); and 2) a lack of controversy out of fear that their brand image might suffer in the mind of the public. This is part of the reason why the media pick domestic topics and focus on high-profile domestic personages (less controversy, and more ""relevant"" to the daily lives of Americans, so thus, more watched). Another reason has to do with the news cycle of the American media. In many countries, the news is still a half-hour, hour, or couple hours per day. In the U.S. with cable news, the news cycle is now 24-hours. This constant pressure to always be turning out stories gives journalists incentives to make their story production as efficient as possible. In practice, this means developing a set of official contacts that they can rely upon for sound bites that relate to their reporting areas. They build trust with these contacts and can count upon them to respond quickly. With major news bureaus tending to be on the east coast of the U.S., it is easier for journalists to develop ongoing relationships with officials who don\'t live at great geographic distances (even with the Internet, I\'d argue). Also, with the rise in prominence of public relations firm (firms that specialize in creating news-worthy promotional material that frames their organizational or individual clients in a favorable light), information about celebrities and American personages is readily available and pre-processed for journalists to be newsworthy, and thus, such material is exceptionally appealing to journalists who by and large are ALL on a very tight deadline.\n\nSome communications researchers in the past have argued that -- with the exception of the elite -- most everyone in all countries would be interested in more gossip, lifestyle, and entertainment news. What stops some countries from providing it is either an authoritarian regime, or perhaps the more benevolent goal of providing an educational service.\n\nIf you\'re really interested in this topic, I suggest a couple of interesting books: *The Creation of the Media* by Paul Starr, and *Deciding What\'s News* by Herbert J. Gans, both of whom are scholars of great repute.'","b'A large part of the America-centric focus of the American media is as a result of its structure.

They're just responding to the things that get the best ratings, and that's news with a local or American-centric slant. \n\nTake for example the coverage of the South Asian Tsunami, which killed far more people than Hurricane Katrina. The majority of the coverage I saw was local-slanted-- people from the vicinity who had been in the tsunami or who were related to victims.  I probably saw more articles about a supermodel who was injured and who lost her fiance in the tsunami than I did REAL coverage. Hurricane Katrina continues to get follow up coverage while we don't hear much about the tsunami's aftermath. I guess because the American viewing audience can more readily relate to these English-speaking Katrina victims.\n\nFrankly, it comes down to the self-centeredness of the American culture. If it doesn't affect people on American soil, they don't care.

Toxins come from your environment and from what you eat.  If what you eat doesn't digest well or if it's crap to begin with, your body wants to get rid of it.  It will poo it out, pee it out, barf it out or sweat it out.  The sweating part is where the acne comes in.\n\nUnfortunately, for most people, becoming vegetarian, while certainly admirable, is not a viable option.  May I suggest paying attention to what you eat for a week and how your body reacts to it.  You could jot it down in a 7-day journal and try to keep track of approximate times.  If you feel bloated, stomach pain, or tired and lethargic, write it down.  After the week, you may notice that you feel crappy after you consume certain foods.  You will certainly be more aware of how food affects you. \n\nCommon food allergies include dairy, wheat and soy.  Eliminating the foods that don't work for your body will cause your skin to clear.  This includes junk food and excessive consumption of meat.  By excessive, I'm talking about more than once a day or big steaks.\n\nYour skin will not clear instantly.

Console controls are not well-suited to FPS style gameplay. The only console that will truly be able to pull this off well is the Nintendo Revolution (which will come out next year).',"b""I have to disagree with the previous answer. I think it really comes down to what you're most familiar with. Personally, I never really got into PC gaming as heavily as I did console gaming. As such, I find a controller much more natural than a keyboard and mouse; much as I'd expect a PC gamer to find a controller awkward and clumsy.\n\nThe keyboard and mouse have many a lot of advantages, and if you pitted a controller-player against a keyboard-and-mouse-player, the controller-player would be at a distinct disadvantage. \n\nAll in all though, console makers and game developers have done a fantastic job of mapping FPS controls to hand-held controllers. It just takes practice. That and you may want to consider adjusting the look sensitivity for your controller.\n\nBut I wouldn't worry too much. With the USB ports on the newer consoles that have hit (Xbox 360) or will be hitting (PS3) the market, you can expect to see some keyboards and mice coming out to appeal to PC gamers.\n\nAs for the Nintendo Revolution's controller, I'm skeptical of how well it will work in practice. It's a great concept, but I think it will prove difficult to execute successfully enough not to become a niche feature. That, coupled with Nintendo's limited FPS library and lack of support from some of the industry's leading FPS developers doesn't give me an optimistic picture of the Revolution being the place to be in terms of getting an FPS fix.""","b""Try inverting your controller if you haven't.

Music that there is just one category for ""classic music"". As far as we have music from at least XV century till now there, this classification doesn\'t mean so much as even the styles are very different there.'","b'You group like with like.  Easy, eh?  Now how you do that is where the talent comes in.  Record stores like to do it by the person performing the music.  That fails when the person decides to play something in a different style than they usually do (e.g., Paul McCartney).  \n\nSo, the only good way to do this, that won\'t fail or change over time, is to group music by it\'s own internal characteristics ... just as we group biological organisms by their DNA.  The many, many characteristics of even one bit of music make this a tough task.  Do you group all music in 3/4 time together?  No.  All music without words?  All music with drums?  All music in an A-B-A form, all music in D major???  See how hard it is!\n\nAnother way that doesn\'t work well, but that people try  to use is to group music by time period.  Music from the 1950s, 1700s, 1990s, etc.  Just look around at the awesome variety of types of music being created today, and you\'ll realize that this classification scheme won\'t work either.\n\nSo, in the end, the best method is to use the music\'s own characteristics, but in more than one dimension.  That is, where you may have more than one bit of music in 3/4, you need to also look at their harmony, instrumentation, form, rhythms, scale, melody, words (if any) and so on.

A lot of people will tell you that the PS3 will have more games, which was the case with the PS2 and the Xbox. However, the Xbox represented Microsoft\'s first real foray into console gaming, so many developers were reluctant to get on board.\n\nHowever, after seeing the success of the Xbox combined with a 6-month (at least) headstart on Sony\'s next-gen console, and the incredible support that Microsoft offers its game development community, many more developers are signing on with the Xbox 360; particularly Japanese developers, which was a shortcoming with Microsoft\'s previous console.\n\nBut really it comes down to what you\'re looking for. A lot of people will say that if you\'re looking for RPGs, you should go with the PS3, citing the PS2 as last generation\'s reigning RPG king in console gaming. Truly, it\'s a matter of preference. If you prefer Western-style RPGs like Morrowind, or Knights of the Old Republic, the 360 will offer a great deal more than the PS3. Even if you\'re looking for Eastern-style RPGs (i.e., Final Fantasy and such), you may want to look again. While the Xbox got little love from Japan\'s premier RPG developers, Square-Enix, the Xbox 360 is seeing a great deal of support coming from them. \n\nBut then again, you\'ve got the exclusive-title to consider. The Xbox 360 offers Halo 3, Perfect Dark Zero, among others. The PS3 has Metal Gear Solid 4, Devil May Cry, and more. So, it really comes down to what you\'re looking for. \n\nStill, the fact remains that Microsoft is a great deal more supportive of its developers, keeping the architecture simple and providing tools to make game production more efficient and cost-effective. On the otherhand, the PS3\'s technology is proving cumbersome and expensive (Source: http://news.teamxbox.com/xbox/9503/Developers-Migrating-from-PS3-to-Xbox-360-Development/). This may also effect what games appear on what console.\n\nTechnologically speaking, the two consoles are pretty evenly matched, though the PS3 has a leg up in some areas. The biggest advantage for the PS3 is the support of BluRay technology. This will allow developers to fit larger games on to the disc and increase performance. However, BluRay hasn\'t taken hold yet, and it\'s entirely possible that it won\'t become popular.\n\nThe PS3 supports seven players, while the 360 supports four. So, if you\'re a social gamer, you may want to take that into account. Me? I can\'t stand split-screen.\n\nMy biggest deciding factor is online support. The Xbox 360 will come with Xbox Live support. It\'s a tried and proven platform, and Microsoft has demonstrated that they have the saavy to provide a stable, user-friendly online experience. Plus, the service will only improve. Sony has said little to nothing about its online plans. So, if you\'re looking for massive online support, then the 360 is the clear winner. If you\'re still leaning towards the PS3, you\'ll have to wait for Sony to elaborate on any online plans they might have.\n\nIn the end, I would say don\'t listen to me, or anyone else that happens to post an answer to this question.

This will cause it to divert oxygen from unimportant parts of the body, like that muscle causing hiccups, to more important parts like the heart, the brain, the organs, etc.  \n\nSo...take a glass of water, slowly exhale.  Pinch your nose.  Take about 5 or 6 sips of water (or more until you can't take it any longer) from the glass...making sure you are taking in WATER ONLY. Do NOT sip any air along with the water.  Stop.  \n\nHold your breath for a few seconds, and inhale slowly. The hiccups should disappear. If not repeat.  \n\nI have found this works 90% of the time.

No oxygen to that muscle, it can't burn energy, no energy, no hiccups.\n\nSo what needs to be done is to simulate DROWNING.  We must trick the body to think it is drowning.  This will cause it to divert oxygen from unimportant parts of the body, like that muscle causing hiccups, to more important parts like the heart, the brain, the organs, etc.  \n\nSo...take a glass of water, slowly exhale.  Pinch your nose.  Take about 5 or 6 sips of water (or more until you can't take it any longer) from the glass...making sure you are taking in WATER ONLY. Do NOT sip any air along with the water.  Stop.  \n\nHold your breath for a few seconds, and inhale slowly. The hiccups should disappear. If not repeat.  \n\nI have found this works 90% of the time.

Still, a great deal of Visual Basic code is in use today and large numbers of developers still use it to create client applications, Web apps, script, and macros embedded in other applications such as Microsoft Excel.""","b'Visual Basic (VB) is an event driven programming language and associated development environment created by Microsoft. In business programming, it has one of the largest user bases.\n\nIt is derived heavily from BASIC and enables rapid application development (RAD) of graphical user interface (GUI) applications, access to databases using DAO, RDO, or ADO, and creation of ActiveX controls and objects. A programmer can put together an application using the components provided with Visual Basic itself.\n\nFEATURES OF THE LANGUAGE\nVisual Basic was designed to be usable by all programmers, whether novice or expert. The language is designed to make it easy to create simple GUI applications, but also has the flexibility to develop fairly complex applications as well. Programming in VB is a combination of visually arranging components on a form, specifying attributes and actions of those components, and writing additional lines of code for more functionality. Since default attributes and actions are defined for the components, a simple program can be created without the programmer having to write many lines of code. Performance problems were experienced by earlier versions, but with faster computers and native code compilation this has become less of an issue.\n\nAlthough programs can be compiled into native code executables from version 5 onwards, they still require the presence of runtime libraries of approximately 2 MB in size. This runtime is included by default in Windows 2000 and later, but for earlier versions of Windows it must be distributed together with the executable.\n\nForms are created using drag and drop techniques. A tools palette is used to place controls (e.g., text boxes, buttons, etc.) on the form (window). Controls have attributes and event handlers associated with them. Default values are provided when the control is created, but may be changed by the programmer. Many attribute values can be modified during run time based on user actions or changes in the environment, providing a dynamic application. For example, code can be inserted into the form resize event handler to reposition a control so that it remains centered on the form, expands to fill up the form, etc. By inserting code into the event handler for a keypress in a text box, the program can automatically translate the case of the text being entered, or even prevent certain characters from being inserted.\n\nA Visual Basic application can consist of one or more windows, or a single window that contains MDI child windows, as provided by the operating system. Dialog boxes with less functionality (e.g., no maximize/minimize control) can be used to provide pop-up capabilities. Controls provide the basic functionality of the application, while programmers can insert additional logic within the appropriate event handlers. For example, a drop-down combination box will automatically display its list and allow the user to select any element. An event handler is called when an item is selected, which can then execute additional code created by the programmer to perform some action based on which element was selected, such as populating a related list.\n\nAlternatively, a Visual Basic component can have no user interface, and instead provide ActiveX objects to other programs via Component Object Model (COM). This allows for server-side processing or an add-in model.\n\nThe language is garbage collected using reference counting, has a large library of utility objects, and has basic object oriented support. Since the more common components are included in the default project template, the programmer seldom needs to specify additional libraries. Unlike many other programming languages, Visual Basic is generally not case sensitive, although it will transform keywords into a standard case configuration and force the case of variable names to conform to the case of the entry within the symbol table entry. String comparisons are case sensitive by default, but can be mad'",b'Visual Basic is a programming lanugage for newcomer. It make programming a fun.',None,None,None,None,None,None,None

According the official Kwanzaa site, ""The first-fruits celebrations are recorded in African history as far back as ancient Egypt and Nubia and appear in ancient and modern times in other classical African civilizations such as Ashantiland and Yorubaland"".\n\nKwanzaa was established in 1966 in the midst of the Black Freedom Movement to affirm the culture and identity of African American peoples and to unify them in a celebration of family, community, and a unique cultural heritage that had been supressed for many centuries under slavery.\n\nThe seven symbols of Kwanzaa are spelled out in Swahili, an East African language. They are the crops, the mat, the candleholder, the corn, the seven candles, the unity cup, and the gifts.

(read: \'n factorial\') is defined as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \'n\'. In mathematical terms:\n\nn! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1\n\nThe basics of Combinatorial algebra:\n\nA permutation is a re-arrangement of a group of objects or a selection out of the group of objects. Each re-arrangement of objects (or the selction) is counted as one permutation. For example, consider two apples to be placed in three boxes, numbered 1,2,3.\nThe different arrangements could then be as follows:\nA1-B1, A2-B2, B3\nA1-B1, B2, A2-B3\nB1, A1-B2, A2-B3\nB1, A2-B2, A1-B3\nA2-B1, B2, A1-B3\nA2-B1, A1-B2, B3\n\nYou can observe that there are six ways to re-arrange two apples in three boxes. \n\nNote that, we have given each apple a distinct identity. Apple 1 is A1 and Apple 2 is A2. However, one can assume that both the apples look alike (A1=A2=A say). \n\nIn other words, both apples are the same and it does not make a difference which of the two apples is chosen.\n\nThe above arrangements can then be divided into two identical sets of three arrangements. This set is called a combination.\n\nThe essential difference between a permutation and a combination is:\n""In a permutation, each object is considered to be distinct, whereas, in a combination, all objects are considered to be alike and indistinct.""\n\nIn other words,\n""A combination is simply a choice of objects, while a permutation is a rearrangement or (sometimes, a re-alignment) of the choice of objects.""'","b""Permutations and combinations\n\nWhen we talk of permutations and combinations in everyday talk we often use the two terms interchangeably. In mathematics, however, the two each have very specific meanings, and this distinction often causes problems. \n\nIn brief, the permutation of a number of objects is the number of different ways they can be ordered; i.e. which is first, second, third, etc. If you wish to choose some objects from a larger number of objects, the way you position the chosen objects is also important. With combinations, on the other hand, one does not consider the order in which objects were chosen or placed, just which objects were chosen. We could summarise permutations and combinations (very simplistically) as \n\nPermutations - position important (although choice may also be important) \nCombinations - chosen important, \nwhich may help you to remember which is which.\n\nPictures on a wall\n\nSuppose you have to put some pictures on the wall, and suppose you only have two pictures: A and B.\n\nYou could hang them\n\nOrder 1                      or\n\nOrder 2                    \n\nNot much of a choice, but it leads on to the difference between permutations and combinations.\n\n \n\nTHE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE\n\nAs mentioned above, there is an important difference between permutations and combinations. In this case, for permutations the order of events is important: order 1 is different from order 2. For combinations, however, it does not matter which picture was hung first. In this example there are two permutations (A, B \xe2\x89\xa0 B, A), but only one combination (A, B = B, A).\n\nAnother way that you may find useful to help you remember is to consider a combination lock. On combination locks you have to turn dials with numbers on so a particular number is given, e.g. '1, 2, 3, 4'. But they do not unlock when if the order is changed (e.g. 2, 1, 3, 4). In this case the order is important.  So combination locks should not be called combination locks but 'permutation' locks.\n\n \nA permutation lock! \n\nNow we know the difference between combinations and permutations let us consider a more complicated picture-hanging problem. First we will look at permutations.\n\n \n\nTwo company, three's a crowd!\n\nThis time you have three pictures, called, not surprisingly, A, B and C. How many different permutations are there for you to hang your works of art? A worrying problem indeed! Let's hang them up. \n\nWhen we hang the first picture we can choose from all three.\n\n  \n\n or  or  \n\nWhen we get to the next picture we have only two to choose from\n\n    or     or     \n\nFinally, for the last picture there isn't a choice \xe2\x80\x93 it's the one that remains. So we get the six permutations\n\n  \n\n  \n     \n\n  \n     \n\n \n \n\nNow this can be worked through, but what if we had 10 pictures. How many permutations would that be? Time for some maths to make it easier.\n\nFor the first picture you had a choice of three. For the second picture you had a choice of two and then you had the last picture, with Hobson's choice (no choice!). Written algebraically this is 3 \xc3\x97 2 \xc3\x97 1. For large numbers this is very time consuming to write out, which is why mathematicians use factorial notation.  \n\nA bit harder\n\nWhat happens if we did have 10 pictures and wanted to choose our three most favourite to hang up? How many permutations would we have then?\n\nFor the first picture on the wall we could choose from all ten. For the next we could choose from the remaining nine, and for the third choice we could pick one from eight. 10 \xc3\x97 9 \xc3\x97 8 = 720.\n\nFor this choice of pictures we have 720 permutations, but this isn't 10!.\n\n10! = 10 \xc3\x97 9 \xc3\x97 8 \xc3\x97 7 \xc3\x97 6 \xc3\x97 5  \xc3\x97 4 \xc3\x97 3 \xc3\x97 2 \xc3\x97 1 = 3628800\n\nWe used the first three terms (10 \xc3\x97 9 \xc3\x97 8) but not the rest (7 \xc3\x97 6 \xc3\x97 5 \xc3\x97 4 \xc3\x97 3 \xc3\x97 2 \xc3\x97 1).  But what we can do is work out 10! and then divide by the other bits:\n\n \n\nThe final term is much easier tha""",None,None,None,None,None,None,None

Later, egg-laying birds evolved into chickens.""",b'See: http://qa.yahoo.com/question/?qid=1005111100069',"b""I believe in creation. God created the chicken first. if your looking for somthing that makes sense read the Bible. It's in Genesis(SP) chapter 1.""","b""This is actually very easy to answer, based on evolution the egg had to come first. Evolution works like this: There are slight changes in the genetic information of the sex cells (i.e. eggs and sperm) of individuals that are passed on to the offspring of any two parents. These changes in the genetic makeup are called mutations. Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct. The chicken became a chicken from this other organism through mutations that built up over time in subsequent generations. However, whatever the genetic makeup that finally became defined as a chicken, that individual was first conceived and developed in an egg before being hatched. The egg and sperm that fused to produce the chicken didn't bypass the period of gestation within an egg that had developed in the bird family millions of years before the chicken came along.\n\nSo the simple answer to this question is the egg came first -- unless you believe in fairy tales?\n\nAs far as Nuspirit who wants to claim that the egg that the first chicken was hatched from wasn't a chicken egg... let me ask this question: What defines how we label an egg? The animal that layed it or the animal that is developing in it? I think you could argue either way.\n\nBesides, that is all semantics, because the organism that the chicken evolved from was, more than likely, very similar to the first chicken, the egg that the chicken was layed in would have been so similar to egg that that chicken would eventually lay that you would not have been able to discern between the two.""","b'I think it would be chicken.\n\nWhere will the egg come from? Animals evolved from small living cells. Eggs would have to come from an animal. Also, if the egg did come first, it still needs a chicken to lay on top of it to hatch.'","b'It would have to be the chicken. Evolution happens through mutations. And when the first mutated chicken originated, it would have had to come from another animal (or its egg). We cannot refer to that mutated egg as ""egg"" in this context because it was not a chicken-egg, it was the egg of some precursor animal.\nOnly when the first mutated chicked successfully surived and mated could it lay and hatch an ""egg"".'",None,None,None,None

Mutations can either have: 1) A deleterious effect on the offspring (genetic disorders may arise, many times these are lethal); 2) sometimes these mutations may be advantageous, making an individual more fit than its neighbors (this is sometimes referred to as conferring an advantage); or 3) these mutations can have no effect, making no change from parent to progeny.\n\nIn the case of the chicken, it must have evolved from something else that became less fit than the chicken and eventually becoming extinct.

b'Is it OK to buy a used Home Theater system?',"b""I'm by no means an audiophile, but would like a decent home theater sound system.  What do i need to look out for when buying a used system?  I don't want to invest in a dead technology.  At a minimum, what should I look for?""","b""At a minimum you want 5.1 audio with both DTS and Dolby Digital support.  Beyond that you see diminishing returns, as there's a HUGE leap between Dolby Pro Logic and Dolby Digital sound.  Essentially the 5.1 means there are 5 independent full range channels with a completely independent LFE (low frequency effects) channel.  \n\nThe difference between DTS and Dolby Digital are subtle at best, theoretically DTS is a less compressed format with higher resolution but in the end it comes down the the sound engineering behind the tracks for each individual movie.  However, it's now virtually standard on all receivers and there are many DTS encoded dvds now.\n\nThere are a few newer standards like Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES which add an extra center channel or two to the rear, but in my opinion the extra cost of the speakers is better spent on building a solid 5 speaker (+ subwoofer) system.  Also, in the home placing a rear center channel is problematic and in my opinion more trouble than it's worth.  If you can get a higher end and better built (but older) 5.1 receiver, that's a much better use of your money than a lower end 7.1 system.  Also, the new formats are completely backward compatible with the older ones, so there are no compatibility issues with older gear.\n\nThe 5.1 standards have been out for about 10 years now, but there are no real breakthroughs on the home theater front.  The only thing that I would recommend in terms of future proofing is a set of 5.1 channel inputs on your receiver for an external decoder, though at this point I don't know what that new audio standard would be.\n\nI haven't really mentioned the high def audio formats like SACD or DVD Audio because there isn't a lot of media and to truly take advantage of the better sound you'd have to make a BIG investment in speakers and improving the acoustics of your room.\n\nFor speakers, definitely don't skimp.  My favorite brands (bang for the buck) are Paradigm, PSB, and Energy.  Energy has a sub/sat line called the Take 5 which is all the speakers + subwoofer you need for around $700.  There is a newer model called act6 which is around $800 and is quite good.  In terms of receivers, Denon is good all around, and Yamaha makes good receivers towards the high end. Onkyo is also good. Sony is not great.  Lots of features and nice looking gear but sonically not as good as Denon, Onkyo, or the nicer Yamahas.  When in doubt, see if the receiver is made in Japan.  Usually the Japanese brands reserve their higher spec gear from the Japanese plants.  There is plenty of good stuff which is not made there, but if it is you're in good shape.\n\nI have a Yamaha RXV-2095 which I bought in 1999 and I feel like I have no reason to upgrade for the next few years.  It's a solid receiver with lots of clean amplification.\n\nAlso, if five speakers is a lot of scratch, you can still have great home theater with just the 3 front speakers and a subwoofer.""","b""At a minimum you want 5.1 audio with both DTS and Dolby Digital support.  Beyond that you see diminishing returns, as there's a HUGE leap between Dolby Pro Logic and Dolby Digital sound.  Essentially the 5.1 means there are 5 independent full range channels with a completely independent LFE (low frequency effects) channel.  \n\nThe difference between DTS and Dolby Digital are subtle at best, theoretically DTS is a less compressed format with higher resolution but in the end it comes down the the sound engineering behind the tracks for each individual movie.  However, it's now virtually standard on all receivers and there are many DTS encoded dvds now.\n\nThere are a few newer standards like Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES which add an extra center channel or two to the rear, but in my opinion the extra cost of the speakers is better spent on building a solid 5 speaker (+ subwoofer) system.  Also, in the home placing a rear center channel is problematic and in my opinion more trouble than it's worth.  If you can get a higher end and better built (but older) 5.1 receiver, that's a much better use of your money than a lower end 7.1 system.  Also, the new formats are completely backward compatible with the older ones, so there are no compatibility issues with older gear.\n\nThe 5.1 standards have been out for about 10 years now, but there are no real breakthroughs on the home theater front.  The only thing that I would recommend in terms of future proofing is a set of 5.1 channel inputs on your receiver for an external decoder, though at this point I don't know what that new audio standard would be.\n\nI haven't really mentioned the high def audio formats like SACD or DVD Audio because there isn't a lot of media and to truly take advantage of the better sound you'd have to make a BIG investment in speakers and improving the acoustics of your room.\n\nFor speakers, definitely don't skimp.  My favorite brands (bang for the buck) are Paradigm, PSB, and Energy.  Energy has a sub/sat line called the Take 5 which is all the speakers + subwoofer you need for around $700.  There is a newer model called act6 which is around $800 and is quite good.  In terms of receivers, Denon is good all around, and Yamaha makes good receivers towards the high end. Onkyo is also good. Sony is not great.  Lots of features and nice looking gear but sonically not as good as Denon, Onkyo, or the nicer Yamahas.  When in doubt, see if the receiver is made in Japan.  Usually the Japanese brands reserve their higher spec gear from the Japanese plants.  There is plenty of good stuff which is not made there, but if it is you're in good shape.\n\nI have a Yamaha RXV-2095 which I bought in 1999 and I feel like I have no reason to upgrade for the next few years.

b'What are the major differences between the Prius and the Civic Hybrid?',b'Is one better than the other?',"b'Depends on the kind of driving you do.  There are two types of hybrid systems, parallel and series.  A parallel hybrid, like the Toyota and Ford systems, employs a separate electric motor and gas engine,connected in parallel to the wheels.  Systems like these tend to be better for city driving, and this is usually reflected in the higher EPA city ratings for parallel hybrids.  Parallel hybrids have, until very recently, been the only system that allows independent operation of the electric and gas motors, where the car can operate in pure electric mode at low speeds when the battery has a good charge.\n\nThe Honda employs a series hybrid where the motor is integrated into the transmission and is connected in series to the drive wheels.  These systems typically offer better highway mileage than parallel hybrids but slightly worse around town.  Also typical with these systems is the inability to run the car in pure electric mode, though this has changed with the 2006 Civic Hybrid.\n\nWhile the Prius has been the state of the art in hybrid technology, it is my opinion that the new 2006 Civic Hybrid is the superior vehicle.  It was designed from the ground up with the Prius as a benchmark, and the designers have hit their mark.\n\nI think the Civic will end up being a better driving experience.  The platform was engineered to be the basis for the next generation of Honda vehicles, and the 2006 Civic Si, also based on the same platform, is considered to be the best in its class.  The hybrid shares the same basic suspension as the Si, and will undoubtedly be compatible with the multitude of aftermarket suspension upgrades which will become available shortly for the 2006 civic.'","b'Depends on the kind of driving you do.

b'how can i win at tetris?',,"b'Depending on the version you will ""win"" by getting the most possible points, or by clearing levels the fastest.  Strictly, it is not totally possible to ""win"" except in a few tetris variants and in player vs. player mode.\n\nNow if you\'d like to do well in tetris, here are the ways to achieve the two goals:\n\n1) High points.  Usually getting a tetris (clearing 4 lines at once) is the highest scoring thing you can do.  So getting the highest number of points is equivalent to getting the most tetrises.  The tetris can only be gotten using the long rectangular piece, and there are two schools of thought on how to play.  One school of thought is to the empty slot on the edge of the board.  This gives a 9 block wide mass on which to build.  Generally it is easier to manage this because fewer block masses means less complexity in placement, and fewer problems with ""towers"".  The other school of thought is to have your empty slot right in the middle, in the spot where pressing rotate once will allow your rectangular piece to complete the tetris.  The reason that this is done is in higher levels where pieces fall quickly, there is less time to respond, and if your stack gets high while you are waiting for a long rectangle, then you risk not having enough time to get it to the edge of the board to complete the tetris when it *does* come.  This method will mean that you have two block regions to manage though.\n\n2) Completely levels quickly.  Levels are usually advanced by reaching a certain number of lines, and advancing quickly simply means getting lines completed rapidly.  Learning this takes some practice, and in particular you need to learn some non-intuitive drops.  Here are some examples:\n\n(x) = block part completes line and will clear\n(-) = block part is left\n\nx x x\n  -\n\nx x\n  -\n  -\n\nx x x\n-\n\nThese types of drops are harder to get used to because you brain thinks they will trap ""holes"" in your board.

WavefunctionA (WF_A) is IN NEITHER state until it is ACTUALLY measured.  the moment WF_A it is measured, WF_B assumes the opposite spin with DEFINITE probability.  i understand that no information is transferred at a distance between WF_A and WF_B, but HOW does this happen.  WHAT is the mechanism that collapes WF_B into a definite spin state at a distance? I am not looking for explanations like ""satisfies laws of conservation"" ... instead i am looking for physical mechanism that allow this seemingly incredible phenomena to work.

A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.

Any tips?',"b'Here are a couple of tips from our own experience:\n\n1. most importantly: call the airline and try to get a bassinette, and at least one seat next to it(that\'s the crib that attaches to the wall in front of the bulk head seats). the bassinette itself will probably be too small for your child to actually sleep in, but will hold all the extra stuff that comes along with a toddler. moreover, the extra leg room will give your toddler more space to play that is NOT your lap or the aisle...\nnote: bulk head seats are usually booked first because there\'s more leg room there, but parents with infants on-lap (younger than 2 years) have priority to these seats on most airlines. if you can\'t book the seat in advance, don\'t dispair - you can still get it upon check in: come in early and insist on it! \n2. try to keep the child\'s routine as close to normal as possible. keep meal times and nap times as close as you can to your ""home time"". bring small packs of favorite foods and snacks with you, as plane food is not likely to top your kids list... you can heat up baby food by putting the container in a small cup filled with a half-inch to an inch of boiling water and stirring the contents. ""Gerber"" containers fit perfectly, or you could use the small, round, 4-oz disposable plastic containers (like ""Glad"" or such) which also fit in the coffee cups provided on airplanes.\n3. of course, if your child has a favorite toy, stuffed animal, blankie etc., have it with you on board.\n4. get a bunch of new, real-cheap little toys that you wouldn\'t mind losing / throwing away by the end of the trip. introduce a new one every hour or so -- it\'ll buy you precious time! i\'d put under this category also some little arts & crafts items, like stickers and crayons.\n5. have at least two full changes of baby clothes and lots of extra diapers with you, as well as a small ""baby-bath travel kit"", just in case your layover gets extended, your suitecases go astray, and so on... i\'d also take an extra shirt for mom and dad, for any unfortunate accidents.\n6. on the plane, don\'t be shy - let baby run up and down the isles. fighting it won\'t help anyway, and the excersize is good for you both ;-) plus, the more energy they spend, the more likely they are to fall asleep at some point...\n7. talk to your pediatritian about baby-safe antihistamines - a small dosage may be all the help baby needs to get drowsy and sleep better when they\'re already over-tired, but the strange environment won\'t let them fall asleep...\n8. take a deep breath, and remind yourself that, as hard as this one day may be, it\'s only one day of travel, and it, too, shall pass!\n\ngood luck! :)'","b'Here are a couple of tips from our own experience:\n\n1. most importantly: call the airline and try to get a bassinette, and at least one seat next to it(that\'s the crib that attaches to the wall in front of the bulk head seats). the bassinette itself will probably be too small for your child to actually sleep in, but will hold all the extra stuff that comes along with a toddler. moreover, the extra leg room will give your toddler more space to play that is NOT your lap or the aisle...\nnote: bulk head seats are usually booked first because there\'s more leg room there, but parents with infants on-lap (younger than 2 years) have priority to these seats on most airlines. if you can\'t book the seat in advance, don\'t dispair - you can still get it upon check in: come in early and insist on it! \n2. try to keep the child\'s routine as close to normal as possible. keep meal times and nap times as close as you can to your ""home time"". bring small packs of favorite foods and snacks with you, as plane food is not likely to top your kids list... you can heat up baby food by putting the container in a small cup filled with a half-inch to an inch of boiling water and stirring the contents.

It doesn't matter whether the treadmill is moving forward, backward, or not at all.  The treadmill only affects groundspeed.  But the plane flies through the air, and is ignorant of groundspeed.  The wheels might move a bit faster or slower, but the speed of the plane in relation to the air, as accelerated by it's turboprops, would not be affected one wit.""","b""The plane will take off more quickly on the treadmill than it would on a regular runway.\n\nThe plane's thrust is pushing against the air rather than the runway/treadmill.  The wheels will never spin but the plane will take off.\n\nLet's assume the treadmill is reacting (in the opposite direction) to the force applied to it by the wheels of a given vehicle:\n\nIf a car is on the treadmill and the car is attempting to accelerate left, in order for the treadmill to counteract the rotation of the wheels it would begin moving right.  The car is applying force to the treadmill.\n\nIf a plane is on the treadmill attempting to accelerate left it would begin to move and the treadmill would begin applying force to the wheels causing them to turn.  The treadmill would then begin to move left as well to counteract the force and the turning of the wheels, so in the strictest sense, the treadmill would actually cause the plane to take off more quickly because it has removed the rolling friction caused by the wheels.""","b'Planes gain speed using propellers or jet turbines, NOT by spinning their wheels as cars do.  A treadmill as described would do nothing to prevent the plane from accelerating and reaching take-off velocity.'","b'Planes fly by achieving lift. \n\nLift is created when air pressure is lower above the plane, than below it, pushing the plane into the air. \n\nFor planes, this happens at the wings. When air is flowing around the wings, it is forced to go faster at the top of the wing than at the bottom. This is because the wings are designed so that the top surface is longer than the bottom surface.\n\nWhen the air on top is going faster than the air on the bottom, there is lower pressure on the top than on the bottom, so then there is lift, because the higher pressure on the bottom can push up on the plane.\n\nSo for a plane to achieve lift, the air needs to be moving over the wings. It doesnt matter if the plane is moving.\n\nNormally though, the plane moves relative to the air, so that the air is in effect moving. (think of sticking your hand out of an open car window).\n\nIf the plane was not moving, then the air would need to be accelerated over the wings.\n\nSo for this question, the plane would not take off, because there is no mechanism to get the air moving over the wings. \n\nThe engines are moving air, but not over the wings. The engines are not intended to move air over the wings, but rather to create a force that has an equal and opposite reaction to propel the plane forward, causing the wings to move in relation to the air.'",None,None,None,None

You can get a decent new couch for under $1000, but depending on where you go, will get dramatically different quality for the money. Cheapest and easiest are at Walmart, and other huge discount chains, although your selection is very limited.    If you shop around long enough at garage sales, and 2nd hand furniture stores, you'll probably find a pretty good deal, also. \n\nMy recommendation is to check out Scandinavian designs - they're good but cheap, not WalmartCheap. If you're looking for advice on buying designer-$10K couches' you'll have to ask someone else....""",None,None,None,None,None,None,None,None

However, some still exist on the Strip. \n\nThe biggest one for families is Circus Circus because theyhave their own indoor amusement park, video games and skill games with tickets you can collect for prizes. \n\nThen you have Excalibur with its whole Medival Times theme. \n\nMy choice would be Circus Circus if you're on a tight budget and don't care about the craziness of kids running around, or if you wanna spend a little more, do Excalibur. Its a bit cleaner and more organized and closer to the Mirage (white tiger exhibit), MGM (lion exhibit) and New York (great roller coaster).\n\nTreasure Island used to be family-themed, but they changed that about a yerar or so ago.

My son was 2yrs 9 mos by the time he was really ready to go, and it only took about two weeks. Start too early and you'll have power struggles, many accidents and nothing but frustration. They say bribery should be employed carefully, but we found that a tupperware filled with M&M's was enough to get him motivated to use the toilet and give up his beloved diapers. He got one each time he went (and we eventually weaned him off the reward system). Also, we circumvented the potty altogether as it made it easier for him to use public toilets. Also, many toddler boys prefer to sit when they're learning the new talent, so be patient in his confidence to stand. And be sure to get him on the handwashing bandwagon immediately so he'll know it's part of the process! Oh, and don't make a big deal out of accidents... empathize with him and drive on.
