# CommunityQuestionAnswering

The internet is a rich resource for exchange of knowledge. Community question answering sites such as Yahoo!Answers, Quorand StackOverflow are flowing with questions,answers and a thread of comments. Yet, we often find ourselves trying to decide which answer correctly satisfies the question. Ranking of answers on these platforms is usually performed by users, by upvoting an answer that they prefer. However, this ranking seems to overlook the possibility that a newly added answer is of high importance. Along with that, there is a high possibility of upvoting being biased or for a user to vote incorrectly. Our paper overcomes these issues by using Linear Regression over Heuristic values and Topic Similarity Score calculated from a Topic Modelling algorithm, to produce correct ranking of answers, that keeps getting dynamically updated as new answers are added.
